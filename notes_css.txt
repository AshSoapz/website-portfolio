CSS TIME BABYYY

1) Good thing ab cs is that there is alot more efficient way to do things, 
I would give examples, actually here is one:
You can use this instead of typing out three seperate lines. 
body{
font: 15px/1.5 Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
What this means is that that text size is 15 pixels, 1.5 line height (amount of space between lines of text)

2) For padding, margin and background colour, do this:
body{
    font: 15px/1.5 Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    padding:0;
    margin:0;
    background-color:lightgray;
}

What this means is that the padding is 0, the space between content and border, the margin is also 0,
space outside an elements border, and the background colour is light gray. 

3) Making a container to keep all the images in line
.container{
    width:80%;
    margin: auto;
    overflow:hidden;
}

4) Header-
header{
    background:darkcyan;
    color: white;
    padding-top: 30px;
    min-height: 70px;
    border-bottom: #e8491d 3px solid;
}
Alot is self-explanatory, except for the padding, min height and border bottom ig. 
Padding top means  amount of padding to be added to the top of an element.
Minheight means the minium height of an element, ensure that element will alwyas
have a min height even if its content is smaller than that height. 
Border bottom is used to set the style, width and color of the bottom border of an element. 

5) Now to make the hyperlinks white to contrast the bg color of the header:
header a{
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 16px;
}

6)header li{
    float:left;
    display: inline;
    padding: 0 20px 0 20px;

}
The above means, for the listed items, we want them to float to the left of the container. 
Displayed inline with the other elements. 
Padding is organised into top right bottom and left, with ours having an equal 20px to right and left

7) Some stuff about branding and navbar:
header #branding{
    float:left;
}
This allows for my AshSoapz Services to float to the left and look nice
header #branding h1{
    margin:0;
}
Makes it popout a bit

header nav{
    float:right;
}
nicely floats the nav bar right

8)
The importance of /*global*/
anything underneath this and above its seperator.e.g. /*header**/ are added globally to the 
webpage. 

9) Using Global:
Putting this:ul{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
Under global it makes all ul's have 0 margin padding by default. 

10)header .hightlight, header .current a{
    color: #e8491d;
    font-weight: bold;
}

What we are doing here is making a part of the header be highlighted, and making the link (a) 
highlihgted too. 

and back to html we have <h1><span class="highlight">AshSoapz</span>Services</h1>

this is done to set the class recognisable and match it with the text. 

We obvs would then do it with the links.
                    <li class="current"><a href="index.html"> Home</a> </li>

11) Hover over text, make em bold:
header a:hover{
    color:#cccccc;
    font-weight: bold;

}
