1) To link the index to the stylesheet simply make link tags and establish 
a connection to the stylesheet, make sure it is the correct location.
this should be done in the head section, 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">

2) In terms of responsiveness, when you press alt tab after ! in a html
file, alot of the responsive stuff (meta) has been autofilled. 
This is done to make it usable across many platforms and ratios. 

3)Difference between class and id, you can use either, general rule is 
id is for someething unique.e.g. one time section, doesnt appear everywhere
class is for something that is repeated: navbar, header, etc. 

4)For the case above, you should always put the text in corroborating with the tags.e.g.
<nav> "all things in the navbar" </nav>

5) Unordered list, or /ul, is used to represent a list, collection of items, you usually do this by 
making an <ul> and then putting a <li> item </li> in there and then closing it with </ul>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

Pretty much like that. 

6)as you know, the <a tag is for hyperlinks, the a standing for anchor, used to describe the connection
between a link that connects one page to another:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>

7)When making a showcase section, a nice piece between the navbar and rest of the page below, 
typically used to showcase services, products, etc; you should make it into a <section> tag 
just outside the header tag. 
    <section id="showcase"> 
and then make a div class container, to keep the grouping clear, 
follow it with a header tag and paragraph tag for some text. here is an example:
    <section id="showcase"> 
        <div class="containter"> 
        <h1>Afforable Professional Service</h1>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aliquid odit natus delectus odio eius commodi autem quo, voluptatum numquam dolore hic porro maiores quaerat culpa nemo sit itaque facere aliquam?</p>

        </div>
    </section>

7) Forms, a staple for the modern website, usually below you would have a newletter and a Form
this would usually be more back-end centred, and by that I mean, you would need to know some php 
or input a plugin, but we aint gonna do anything too complex here; just a simple input and buttons. 
    <section id="newsletter">
        <div class="containter">
            <h1>Subscribe To Our Newsletter</h1>
            <form>
                <input type="email" placeholder="Enter Email...">
                <button type="submit" class="button_1">
                    Subscribe
                </button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </section>

8) Making a section showcasing the services you provide is fun, pretty much copy the format above for the rest
making a container, class div, etc. 
just make sure your text is small enough, and to resize images, you can simply make one box and copy it 
down. ::
        <div class="container">
            <div class="box">
                <img src="./images/webdesignwebsitelogo.jpg" alt="">
               <h3>Web Design</h3> 
               <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Similique commodi ratione, alias autem et sequi veniam adipisci nemo tempore, eaque nostrum fugiat a accusamus aut dolores quasi provident saepe corporis?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <img src="./images/pentesterwebsitelogo.png" alt="">
                <h3>Pen Testing</h3> 
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Similique commodi ratione, alias autem et sequi veniam adipisci nemo tempore, eaque nostrum fugiat a accusamus aut dolores quasi provident saepe corporis?</p>
             </div>
             <div class="box">
                <img src="./images/gamedesignwebsitelogo.png" alt="">
                <h3>Game Design</h3> 
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Similique commodi ratione, alias autem et sequi veniam adipisci nemo tempore, eaque nostrum fugiat a accusamus aut dolores quasi provident saepe corporis?</p>
             </div>
        </div>
    </section>
